Modular and hackable open-source web analytics platform.

## How is it Different from Google Analytics or Matomo?

Unlike Google Analytics it is free and open-source.

Unlike Matomo, it not a monolithic application, but rather a set of modules,
which based on different established open-source technologies: Snowplow,
PrestoDB, Cube.js, and React with Material UI on frontend. You can change or
replace any component with technology that better fits your needs. Additionally, due to Cube.js data schema you can customize how metrics and dimensions are defined in a case the default definitions don't work for you.

## Installation

### 1. Configure Data Collection with Snowplow

The data collection part is handled by Snowplow. Follow the Snowplow's [Setup Guide](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/Setting-up-SnowPlow) to install tracker, collector and Enrich.

Snowplow comes with an S3 Loader and we recommend using it. Alternatively you
can load your data in HDFS.

### 2. Setup Athena (S3 only) or Presto

Once you have data in the S3 or HDFS the next step is to setup Athena or Presto
to query it. We'll describe only Athena with S3 setup here, but you can easily find a
lot of materials online how to setup an alternative configuration.

To query S3 data with Athena we need to create a table for Snowplow events. Copy and paste the following DDL statement into the Athena console. Modify the `LOCATION` for the S3 bucket that stores your enriched Snowplow events.

### 3. Install MySQL for Cube.js External Pre-Aggregations

### 4. Install Cube.js backend and React frontend applications
Docker container
Configure via env variables

### Enable Authentication via Google OAuth 2 (Optional)

You can enable authentication to let only users with emails with specific domain
to sign in. To enable it you need to define the following environment variables -

```bash
GOOGLE_AUTH_DOMAIN=DOMAIN-TO-ALLOW-SIGN-INS-FROM
GOOGLE_AUTH_REDIRECT=URL-OF-YOUR-DEPLOYMENT (e.g.: https://analytics.myapp.com)
GOOGLE_AUTH_CLIENT_ID=GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
GOOGLE_AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
```

To obtain `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` you must register an application with Google. If you have not already done so, a new project can be created in the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/). Your application will be issued a client ID and client secret. You will also need to configure a redirect URI which should match the following patter - `GOOGLE_AUTH_REDIRECT/auth/google/callback`, where `GOOGLE_AUTH_REDIRECT` is an environment variable you defined before.
